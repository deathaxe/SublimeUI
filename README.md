# Sublime UI

Sublime Text 3127+ comes with a new UI module in the Default package which is used to easily change _color schemes_ and _themes_.

It provides nearly the same functionality as [Theme Menu Switcher](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Themes%20Menu%20Switcher) package.

This package adds some patches to Sublime Text's default UI module which I think should be added.

The main intention of this repository is to provide easy to read information about the changes proposed to be applied to the default UI module.
